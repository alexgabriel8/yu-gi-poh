# Yu-Gi-Poh

Rock, Paper, Scissors game using Yu-Gi-Oh as setting. Built with HTML, CSS, JS and some [RPGUI](https://github.com/RonenNess/RPGUI) assets in a [DIO](https://web.dio.me/) Bootcamp.

Fun fact: the name Yu-Gi-Poh is a play with Yu-Gi-**Oh** and Jo-Ken-**Po** (another name for Rock, Paper, Scissors).
